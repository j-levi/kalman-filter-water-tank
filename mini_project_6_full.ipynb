The tank has an input, a water\ntap, which can add water to the tank and increase the water level. Water level is measured by a\nlevel sensor.\nThe goal is to use Kalman filter to estimate the level of the water in the tank using the noisy\nmeasurements coming from the level sensor. Assume that the dynamics and the measurements\nare modeled by the following equations:\n\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc5b + 1) = \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc5b) + \ud835\udc35 \ud835\udc62(\ud835\udc5b) + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc5d\n\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc5b) + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc5a\nHere, \ud835\udc62(\ud835\udc5b) is the input to the system.
